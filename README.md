# RUNME

Run a code section in a README.md

## Usage

In a console, run:

```
runme README.md 1
```

where the second code section (section 1) has something like this:

```
console.log('hello world');
```

which will run the above code.

Or you can 'name' your sections like so:

named
```
console.log('named section')
```
